What this metod do 
First, two arrays are declared: the initial one (arrayA) and the second one(arrayB) of the same length. Then a method in which the loop is commensurate with the length of the array, inside the loop the condition check ( <=3 ), if it is true, the element of the first array is entered into the count element of the second array. The count variable to alternately throw from the first array to the second and so that there are no spaces later. After the assignment, the count variable is incremented by 1 and returns to the for loop in which i is incremented by 1. And so it is checked to the end
